/*
    For this practice project I would like you to to program the following in javascript:

    1.) Create a function that returns a random value between 0 and 255 **Hint: this can be done by using the following ===>>> Math.floor(Math.random() * 255);

    2) Create another function that uses the random number generator to generate a new random color with **Re-watch https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-loops/the-refactor-challenge-duplicate-code to see how you can make an rgb string with a random number generator.

    3) Use query selector to grab the div with the class "container-fluid"

    4) use query selector to grab the button

    5) Add an event listener to the button. The event listener should change the background-color CSS property on the container fluid div to the new randomly generated color every time the button is clicked.
